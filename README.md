How flexible is your implementation, e.g., how you add or remove in future new drink types?
It will be really simple for me to do it. I use if to solve which kind of customer like and use another if to solve the tye. 
It means if I like to add or remove a drink,I just have to typr it.

## How is the simplicity and understandability of your implementation?
All my code is the same idea. the big if { middle if { small if }}} I just have to know which level is I want that it. 
Also because each level's code are basiclly same. I just have to copy and past different level's code then I can solve the problem. 
###
â€¢ How you avoided duplicated code?
Accutally I'm not trying to avoid the duplicated code. It is because each code I put in is super simple and easy to understand. 
It can help the other people to understand what I did.
